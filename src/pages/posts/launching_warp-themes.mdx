  After working on Warp-Themes for the last few months,
  I can proudly present it to you now.
  Originally starting just as a prototype, 
  which was ready to be scrapped, it developed into a
  full-fledged project, and my first that would be published.

## What is Warp-Themes.com?

[Warp-Themes](https://warp-themes.com) is a visual theme builder for the [Warp Terminal](https://warp.dev/).
With it, the theme creation process for Warp just got way easier.
Visually select the colors you want, import an existing iTerm Color scheme or use our [Companion Extension for VS-Code](https://warp-themes.com/companion)
to theme your Warp Terminal. And the installation process for your theme is just as easy as running _one_ command.

If you want to try it out, visit [Warp-Themes.com](https://warp-themes.com/).
